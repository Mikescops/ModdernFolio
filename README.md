## Homepage configuration


To show your own post type on the homepage you need to modify the index.twig template on line 16, change "entries" by what you want.

To configure your profile header, create an about page > upload your profile picture and add your description in the textarea.


This theme is fully responsive, so you don't need any mobile template.
